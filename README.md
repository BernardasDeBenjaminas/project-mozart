## Why did I create it?

I go jogging with my trusted mp3 player that's about 10 years old.  
That brick only plays .mp3 files (no Spotify).  
I like my playlists organised so I edit my songs (change album covers, etc.).  
I used to use mp3tag.exe for it but I hated its design too much.  
So I created my own app to replace it.  
Plus I wanted to learn react.
